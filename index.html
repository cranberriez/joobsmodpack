                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 1 - Downloading CurseForge</h4>
                        <p>If you don't already have the CurseForge launcher installed, you can download it <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/download/app">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>You will probably want to download the <em>Standalone</em> version to avoid Overwolf bloat.</p>

                        <h4>Step 3 - Creating Profile</h4>
                        <p>Navigate to the minecraft tab of cursefoge and select <em>Create Custom Profile</em>.</p>
                        <img src="cursestep3.png" alt="Instruction 3">
                    </li>

                        <h4>Step 4 - Importing</h4>
                        <p>Select <span style="text-decoration: underline;">import</span> and find the .zip you downloaded.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 5 - Increasing Minecraft's Memory</h4>
                        <p>Navigate to Profile Options and modify the amount of memory your game will be using.</p>
                        <img src="cursestep5a.png" alt="Instruction 5a">
                        <p>Adjust the memory according to the memory available on your system.</p>
                        <ul id="memory-settings">
                            <li><strong><div>System</div> Game</strong></li>
                            <li><div>8 GB</div> 5,500MB</li>
                            <li><div>16 GB</div> 8,000MB</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>These are just recommended. Don't go below 5,500MB or above 12,000MB</p>
                        <img src="cursestep5b.png" alt="Instruction 5b">

                <h3>Alternative Launchers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>Alternatives to CurseForge are not limited to these two examples, there are many others. Almost all alternatives have methods to import CurseForge packs.</p>
                    <p>Importing the modpack should be a similar process to Curseforge with buttons in different places. <strong>Don't forget to adjust memory.</strong></p>
                    <p>These launchers might automatically open a browser during the installation process. This is NORMAL, as some mods are required to be downloaded this way due to third party limitations.</p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Prism Launcher</h4>
                        <p>Prism Launcher can be downloaded <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">here</a>. It is an adfree alternative to Curseforge, although basic looking it has more functionality than CurseForge. It is safe.</p>
                        <img src="prismlauncher.webp" alt="Prism Launcher Exampe">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>AT Launcher</h4>
                        <p>AT Launcher can be downloaded <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">here</a>. Another alternative to CurseForge and is very similar to Prism Launcher. Slightly harder to navigate than Prism or Curse.</p>
                        <img src="atlauncher.png" alt="AT Launcher example">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Other Options</h4>
                        
                        <img src="gdlauncher_logo.svg" alt="AT Launcher example" style="width: 32px;"> <p>GD Launcher is another good and safe alternative and can be found <a href="https://gdlauncher.com/en/">here</a></p>
                        <br>

                        <img src="infinity32.png" alt="MultiMC" style="width: 32px;"><p>MultiMC is a lesser known but good alternative as well. I cannot personally vouch for this launcher though. Found <a href="https://multimc.org/">here</a></p>

        <h2>Note About Safety</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>About a month ago an individual gained access to multiple Curse Forge Mod accounts and uploaded malicious version of those mods to be available to the public.</p>
            <p>This was very quickly discovered and taken down. Mod developers and communities quickly released fixes and tools to detect the malicious code which locked down the problem.</p>
            <p>This was scary but was fixed quickly. I have done my due diligence when creating this pack. All mods have updated and checked to confirm no such malicious code.</p>
            <p>The modpack will rarely be updated, and all mod updates will be double checked to confirm validity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
