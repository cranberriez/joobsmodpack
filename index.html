                <h3>CurseForge Installation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 1 - Downloading CurseForge</h4>
                        <p>If you don't already have the CurseForge launcher installed, you can download it on the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/download/app" target="_blank">CurseForge Launcher</a> page.</p>
                        <p>You will probably want to download the <em>Standalone</em> version to avoid Overwolf bloat.</p>
                        <img src="cursestep1.png" alt="Instruction 1">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 2 - Downloading The Pack</h4>
                        <p>Download the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/download/app">Lite Modpack here</a> or via the download button above. You don't have to unzip it.</p>
                        <!-- <img src="instruction2.png" alt="Instruction 2"> -->
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 3 - Creating Profile</h4>
                        <p>Navigate to the minecraft tab of CurseForge and select <em>Create Custom Profile</em>.</p>
                        <img src="cursestep3.png" alt="Instruction 3">
                    </li>

                        <h4>Step 4 - Importing</h4>
                        <p>Select <span style="text-decoration: underline;">import</span> and find the .zip you downloaded. You don't have to unzip it.</p>
                        <img src="cursestep4.png" alt="Instruction 4">

                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 5 - Increasing Minecraft's Memory</h4>
                        <p>Navigate to Profile Options and modify the amount of memory your game will be using. You can also modify this in CurseForge settings in the minecraft tab to make this a global setting.</p>
                        <img src="cursestep5a.png" alt="Instruction 5a">
                        <p>Adjust the memory according to the memory available on your system.</p>
                        <img src="cursestep5b.png" alt="Instruction 5b">
                        <ul id="memory-settings">
                            <li><strong><div>System</div> Game</strong></li>
                            <li><div>8 GB</div> 5,500MB</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>These are just recommended. Don't go below 5,500MB or above 12,000MB</p>

                <h3>Alternative Launchers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p style="color: red">Note! This does not fully work. The pack will be incomplete!</p>
                    <p>Alternatives to CurseForge are not limited to these two examples, there are many others. Almost all alternatives have methods to import CurseForge packs.</p>
                    <p>Importing the modpack should be a similar process to Curseforge with buttons in different places. <strong>Don't forget to adjust memory.</strong></p>
                    <p>These launchers might automatically open a browser during the installation process. This is NORMAL, as some mods are required to be downloaded this way due to third party limitations.</p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 1 - Download Alternative Version of the Pack</h4>
                        <p><a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Alternative pack download here</a>. The alternative version of the pack doesn't include a couple mods that can't be downloaded with third party apps.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 2 - Import Pack Into Launcher of Choice</h4>
                        <p>Every pack has a different method of doing this, import the zip you downloaded before and everything should be downloaded automatically.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 3 - Unzip Downloaded Pack and Copy Contents</h4>
                        <p>Config, DefaultConfig and Options.txt need to be copied into the base folder of the newly created modpack. The launcher should have a way to 'view instance/folder' which is where you need to copy the files into.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 4 - Download the Following Mods and Copy Into Mod Folder</h4>
                        <p>Download the mods linked below. The links should lead directly to the required version.</p>
                        <p><a href="">Sodium</a></p>
                        <p><a href="">Iris Shaders</a></p>
                        <p><a href="">Snow Under Trees</a></p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h4>Prism Launcher</h4>
                        <p><a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism Launcher can be downloaded here</a>. It is an adfree alternative to CurseForge, although basic looking it has more functionality than CurseForge. It is safe.</p>
                        <img src="prismlauncher.webp" alt="Prism Launcher Exampe">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>AT Launcher</h4>
                        <p><a href="https://atlauncher.com/downloads" target="_blank">AT Launcher can be downloaded here</a>. Another alternative to CurseForge and is very similar to Prism Launcher. Slightly harder to navigate than Prism or Curse.</p>
                        <img src="atlauncher.png" alt="AT Launcher example">
                    </li>

                        <h4>Other Options</h4>
                        
                        <p><a href="https://gdlauncher.com/en/" target="_blank"><img src="gdlauncher_logo.svg" alt="AT Launcher example" style="width: 32px; margin-bottom: -10px">GD Launcher</a> is another good and safe alternative</p>
                        <br>

                        <p><a href="https://multimc.org/" target="_blank"><img src="infinity32.png" alt="MultiMC" style="width: 32px; margin-bottom: -10px">MultiMC Launcher</a> is a lesser known but good alternative as well. I cannot personally vouch for this launcher though.</p>

        <h2>Note About Safety</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>A couple months ago an individual gained access to multiple Curse Forge Mod accounts and uploaded malicious code version of those mods to be available to the public. It was referred to as fractureiser.</p>
            <p>This was very quickly discovered and taken down. Mod developers and communities quickly released fixes and tools to detect the malicious code which locked down the problem.</p>
            <p>This was scary but was fixed quickly. I have done my due diligence when creating this pack. All mods have updated and checked to confirm no such malicious code.</p>
            <p>The modpack will rarely be updated, and all mod updates will be double checked to confirm validity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
